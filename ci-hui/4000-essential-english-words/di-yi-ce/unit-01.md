**The Lion and the Rabbit**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/unit-01-story-the_lion_and_the_rabbit.jpg)

A **cruel** lion lived in the forest. Every day, He killed and ate a **lot** of animals. The other animals were **afraid** the lion would kill them all.

The animals told the lion, “Let’s make a deal. If you **promised** to eat only one animal each day, then one of us will come to you every day, Then you don’t have to **hunt** and kill us.”

The plan sounded **well** though-out\(慎重考虑后产生的\) to the lion. So he **agreed**, but he also said, “If you don’t come every day, I promise to kill all of you the next day!”

Each day after that, one animal went to the lion so that the lion could eat it. Then all the other animals were **safe**.

**Finally**, it was the rabbit’s turn to go to the lion. The rabbit went very slowly that day, so the lion was **angry** when the rabbit finally **arrived**.

The lion angrily asked the rabbit, “Why are you late?”

“I was **hiding** from another lion in the forest. That lion said he was the king , so I was afraid.”

The lion told the rabbit, “I am the only king here! Take me to that other lion, and I will kill him.”

The rabbit **replied**, “I will be happy to show you where he lives.”

The rabbit led the lion to an old well in the **middle** of forest. The well was very deep with water at the **bottom**. The rabbit told the lion, “Look in there. The lion lives at the bottom.”

When the lion looked in the well, he could see his own face in the water. He thought that was the other lion. Without waiting another **moment**, the lion jumped into the well to **attack** the other lion. He never came out.

All of the other animals in the forest were very **pleased** with the rabbit’s **clever** **trick**.
